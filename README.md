## Variational Bayesian Approach to Movie Rating Prediction

Implemented Variational EM algorithm (proposed in the paper:https://www.cs.uic.edu/liub/KDD-cup2007/proceedings/variational-Lim.pdf) using probabilistic matrix factorization to perform movierating prediction and computed RMSE values using various datasets and rank values
